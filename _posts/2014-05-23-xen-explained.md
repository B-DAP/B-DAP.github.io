## Xen

is a hypervisor using a microkernel design, providing services that allow multiple computer operating systems to execute on the same computer hardware concurrently.

The University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory developed the first versions of Xen. The Xen community develops and maintains Xen as free and open-source software, subject to the requirements of the GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2. Xen is currently available for the IA-32, x86-64 and ARM instruction sets.
